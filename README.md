COMP2401 Assignment 4<br>

Purpose of software: Accepts a set of unsigned integers and determines which
numbers are prime number

Compliation instructions:
open file directory in terminal,
then to compile type: <br>
make -f Makefile0	for Task0<br>
make -f Makefile1	for Task1<br>
make -f Makefile2	for Task2<br>
make -f Makefile3	for Task3<br>

to run type with a given bin file: fileName (eg. prime.bin): 
./singlePrime fileName	for Task 1
./singleSpawn fileName	for Task 2
./multiSpawn fileName	for Task 3

Limitations :
multiSpawn with print all 10 but then will remain in the loop, so end with ctrl^c
